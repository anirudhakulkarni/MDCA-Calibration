# MDCA-Calibration
Deep neural Networks make overconfident mistakes. The aim of Multi-class Difference in Confidence and Accuracy (MDCA) is to align the probability estimates in accordance with accuracy thereby enhancing the trust in DNN decisions. MDCA can be used in case of image classification, image segmentation, and natural language classification tasks.
